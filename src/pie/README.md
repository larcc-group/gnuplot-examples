## Pie plot in Gnuplot

Gnuplot does not support pie plots, as can be seen [here](http://www.gnuplot.info/faq/faq.html#x1-510005.8). To use the pie plot in Gnuplot, you will need to draw your own circles, which can be really annoying.

Below are two links that will help you to create a pie plot in Gnuplot:

- [Gnuplot circles](http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo/circles.html)
- [Pie plot example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31901113)


## Disclaimer

I would choose a library that already supports pie plots, like Matplotlib. If you choose to use Gnuplot, good luck!
